### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile!  
I'm just a normal dude who enjoys programming.  
My current focus lies around game programming and the Unity game engine.

## Games
You can find the relased games I have been a part of over at my [itch.io](https://mrjackey.itch.io/).

If you are interested in the development of these games, feel free to check out their repositories.
