### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile!  
I'm just a normal dude who enjoys programming.  
My current focus lies around game programming and the Unity game engine but I'm also interested in any other kind of programming.

## [Unity Utilities](https://github.com/MrJackey/UnityUtilities)
During my time working in Unity I have created a collection of tools and utilities, both as a way to learn more about the engine but also to create things that I actually want to use myself. I have created a repository where all these can be found and they are all free to use under the MIT License. The tools ranges from simple one-file utilities like extension methods and static utilities to larger packages like a behaviour tree system with a visual node editor.

## Games
I have been part of developing "Deliver At All Costs", a game releasing May 22 2025. 
> "Deliver At All Costs is a thrilling action game where destruction, absurdity and intrigue collide! Step into the shoes of Winston Green â€” a down-on-his-luck courier with a fiery temper and a mysterious past â€” as he delivers highly unconventional cargo, leaving a trail of havoc and chaos behind him."

During that project I was tasked with programming a little bit of everything but I focused mostly on game systems, interactive user interface, tools and third-party and PC platform integrations.

###### Other Games

When first learning to develop games I was also part of building and releasing other games. These are all available on my [itch.io](https://mrjackey.itch.io/) if you want to try them out. But if you are instead interested in the development of these games, feel free to check out their repositories down below.
